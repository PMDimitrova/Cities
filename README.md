Hello!

This is a very very simple React app, which has only one purpose ->
to fetch data for some cities and display it in a table.

If you want to see it in action:

1. Clone the repository
2. Instal all needed dependencies with 'npm instal'
3. Run the project with 'npm start'

Firebase Realtime DB - 'https://cities-819f6-default-rtdb.europe-west1.firebasedatabase.app/.json'
